### ðŸ‘‹, I'm Biagio, PhD student @ University of Salerno.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Decentralized Identity Management using Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs); my research interest regards Web Decentralization and Internet of Things (IoT) Security. I'm also working on project related to the optimization of energy efficiency in Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT), which is a really interesting field for the future.


- ðŸ’¬ Blockchain, Web Dec, Internet of Things and Networking; I'm addicted to all these things.


- ðŸ“« You can add me as friend on Solid platform, <a href="https://bboi.solidcommunity.net/profile/card">bboi</a> and send me a message there or you can use usual centralized things like <a href="mailto:biagioboi@gmail.com">email</a>.


- âš¡ When I was fifteen, I began to consider the notion of providing free Web access to everyone by establishing a network in which each device acts as an access pointÂ for the others. If at least one user is linked to a high-speed connection, everyone will have free access. I was young and thought that a solution based on this technology may be a revolution for my slow Internet connection (100 kb/s), but as I grew older, I realized that such an approach could be a revolution also for who wants to expand their knowledge without paying for it. I hope that one day everyone will have free access to the Internet.
